## About This Plugin

This plugin is built on top of [obsidian-pets](https://github.com/hiden2000/obsidian-pets) by hiden2000, with animation logic adapted from [stardew-pet-farm](https://github.com/PROF0UND/stardew-pet-farm) by PROF0UND. It extends the original with Stardew Valley characters, AI-powered speech bubbles, expanded NPC interactions, and a redesigned settings system.

## Features

### Pets & NPCs

- **11 pet species** with 55+ color variants: cats, dogs, chickens, cows, ducks, rabbits, dinosaurs, parrots, junimos, raccoons, and turtles — each with idle, walk, special, and sleep animations
- **35 Stardew Valley NPCs** including Abigail, Sebastian, Lewis, Robin, and more — each with their own walking animations and personality
- All sprites use authentic Stardew Valley pixel art

### Display Modes

- **Panel mode**: Pets live in a resizable panel you can dock anywhere in your workspace
- **Overlay mode**: Pets roam freely across your entire Obsidian window
- Drag pets to reposition them, or let them wander on their own
- Click a pet to show a heart, right-click to trigger a speech bubble

### AI-Powered Speech Bubbles

Pets and NPCs can comment on your notes using AI, with configurable persona-based responses:

- **Right-click** a pet to get a contextual comment about your current note
- **Auto-rant mode**: Pets periodically speak up on their own at random intervals
- Supports **OpenAI**, **Google Gemini**, **DeepSeek**, and **Alibaba Bailian** (any OpenAI-compatible API)
- Each species and NPC has a unique personality that shapes their dialogue
- Optional Chinese-language prompt mode for all AI interactions

### Backgrounds

9 themed backgrounds inspired by Stardew Valley seasons and locations:
